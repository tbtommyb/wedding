Please don't feel obliged to give us any kind of gift - you being there is enough for us!

If you do want to give a gift, we've been living together for a couple of years so we have all the things we need. After the wedding we are planning to go to travelling and working abroad for a year, so we'd be very grateful for any contribution you wanted to make to that.
