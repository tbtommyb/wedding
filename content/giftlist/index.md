Please don't feel obliged to give us any kind of gift - you being there is enough for us!

We've been living together for a couple of years and have all the things we need so we do not have a giftlist.

After our wedding we are going to travel and work abroad for a year, so we'd be very grateful for any contribution you would like to make to that.

If you'd like to do it in advance, please send to:

Georgina Johnson and Thomas Barrett  
11 Cecil Mansions  
Marius Road  
Balham  
London  
SW17 7QN  

Or if you'd prefer, you can make an online gift by clicking [here](https://www.paypal.me/tomandgeorgie).
