Please don't feel obliged to give us any kind of gift - you being there is enough for us!

If you would like to make a gift, we've been living together for a couple of years so we have all the things we need.

After our wedding we are going to travel and work abroad for a year, so we'd be very grateful for any contribution you would like to make. If you prefer, you can make an online gift by clicking [here](https://www.paypal.me/tomandgeorgie).
