## Dress code

The dress code is summer formal.

## Ceremony

The ceremony will be at Merton College Chapel at **1.15pm**. The address is:

Merton College  
Merton Street  
Oxford  
OX1 4JD

There will be some parking spaces available about 15-20 minutes' walk from the chapel at St Catherine's College on Manor Road (OX1 3UJ).

The traffic in Oxford on a Friday afternoon can be very heavy so we recommend allowing an extra 20 minutes for your journey time.

## Wedding breakfast and reception

The wedding breakfast and reception will be at:

Riverside Weddings  
Newbridge Farm  
Newbridge  
Standlake  
Oxfordshire  
OX29 7QD

It's about 20 minutes drive west of Oxford along the A420. Look for the Maybush or Rose Revived pubs and then turn off the A415 at the sign for Newbridge Farm.

There will be a cash bar at the venue.

## Taxis

We strongly recommend booking your taxis in advance, particularly at the end of the night as local companies may stop running at midnight. Some suggested companies are:

* ABC Radio Taxis - 01865 242 242, bookings@abcradiotaxis.co.uk

* GO Green Taxi - 01235 811 100
